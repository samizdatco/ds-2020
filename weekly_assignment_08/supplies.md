# Physical computing needs for Data Structures, fall 2020

## Item 1: Microcontroller/development board. Buy one of the following from Particle:

You will be working with a sensor that needs 24/7 connectivity to the internet for about a month or so (roughly late October to early December). Ideally, this will be through your wifi connection at home. If you are able to use your wifi at home, purchase this WiFi Development Board: [Particle Photon Wifi Development Board](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://store.particle.io/collections/wifi/products/photon&sa=D&ust=1602368866313000&usg=AOvVaw2ATI4pgzpvbW_0M_5DAevA), $19.65

If WiFi is absolutely not an option, then you will buy a development board that connects over a cellular network. The product name is Particle Electron; purchase [this one if you are in the Americas or Australia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://store.particle.io/collections/cellular/products/electron-3g-americas&sa=D&ust=1602368866314000&usg=AOvVaw1PNmLW-iPM6oTxahCIYf1h)($49.95), or purchase [this one if you are in Europe/Asia/Africa](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://store.particle.io/collections/cellular/products/electron-3g-kit-intl&sa=D&ust=1602368866315000&usg=AOvVaw209SUd6Qb6PREbpzoEYugA) ($49.95).

## Item 2: Sensor. Buy one of the following from Adafruit*

For this project, you will work with quantitative data from a sensor. I recommend [this temperature sensor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adafruit.com/product/385&sa=D&ust=1602368866315000&usg=AOvVaw2Oqb6J3CA325KY1d6zioQ1) ($9.95) because it includes all the necessary parts and there’sno assembly required (particularly if you don’t have access to a soldering iron and don’t want to purchase one). But if you like, you can choose from any number of sensors. If you want to try several, here’s [a kit of ten sensors](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adafruit.com/product/176&sa=D&ust=1602368866315000&usg=AOvVaw2mquUdcejny9L0tp-MkNc3). Or you can [try anything you want](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adafruit.com/category/35&sa=D&ust=1602368866316000&usg=AOvVaw1k_ieYhokL124VdI6imHNq), just be mindful of any required equipment or peripherals (e.g. soldering iron, resistors, wire strippers, pliers, etc.). If you’re considering anything other than the recommended temperature sensor, please discuss it with me before purchasing.

Items 3 and 4 and (maybe) 5, necessary peripherals: buy these items from Adafruit*

  * [These jumper wires](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adafruit.com/product/3142&sa=D&ust=1602368866316000&usg=AOvVaw2t-M0pKP1TQ2jlckQLOa2f) ($3.95)
  * [This breadboard](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adafruit.com/product/64&sa=D&ust=1602368866317000&usg=AOvVaw0ORLKvDRU9Pyyc2Em3JoLe) ($5.00)
  * Also, you need a [USB-micro cable](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adafruit.com/product/3439&sa=D&ust=1602368866317000&usg=AOvVaw3Cr0qfCqQpqHajuznkEAAj) for power. Most people have one of these lying around, but if you don’t, you should purchase one.
