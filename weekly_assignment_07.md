# Weekly Assignment 7

### Due Tuesday 10/20 at 6:00pm

Finish parsing and cleaning the rest of the data in your assigned "zone" (the zone that corresponds with the last digit of your student ID number) and all other zones, and update/replace your PostgreSQL table(s) with the new data. This should include **all the data** you need for the final map in Final Assignment 1.

### Details

Go back to the raw file you saved in Weekly Assignment 1 and finish parsing the rest of the file (that you started doing in Weekly Assignment 2). Parse and clean **all** relevant data that you will need to map and display the AA meetings for your zone. Make sure everything is geocoded (Weekly Assignment 3) and replace the table(s) you wrote in Weekly Assignment 4 with the new, complete (and **cleaned!**) data. 

Then do the same for the remaining zones. For this assignment, you must have parsed/cleaned **all ten zones**.

## Submission requirements

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant file(s). In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository.
